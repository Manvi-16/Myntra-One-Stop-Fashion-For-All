# Myntra-One-Stop-Fashion-For-All
Web scraping, filtering, and web page for creating a runway fashion show for increasing user interaction on the Myntra Platform.
the basic idea is that we will be giving opportunity to the young budding artists worldwide to design their new flashy trendy clothes on the Clo3D software. After that using the image and text scrapping as the backend, we will create a data set that will be like a storehouse of all the  new trends in social media platforms. Using that dataset we will perform the filtering on the submissions received. and for the final pieces of art, we will create  a fashion runway show showing the talented work of emerging artists. from which the audience will have the chance to vote for the best dress according to their preference and the total vote for each dress will be taken into account, adding the most trendy outfits to Muntra's Store, with the people who voted for that dress availing special discounts.
